# Traffic Operation Surveillance System (TOSS)

| WELCOME TO TOSS (TRAFFIC OPERATION SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM) |

 ---------------
| Introduction |
 ---------------

TOSS is a traffic violation management system for regular people, where necessary action is taken in the event of a violation. TOSS is a web application built with Node.js. With TOSS, it is now easy to manage traffic violations and vehicle license registration. Everything is now simple to do: report any problems, obtain violation information, bring a lawsuit against drivers, obtain owner information, and pay your fine. To assure users' service and security, admin will keep an eye on and manage all user activity.

Thank you everyone.

| Background Informations |
---------------------------


The modern world is all about technology. This digitalization also can be seen in the field of Traffic Violation Control. Nowadays, there are a lot of vehicles running on the roads. It is a necessary thing for everyone to move from one place to another. It saves time and energy, too. But managing these things is a bigger challenge now. 

Now a days we can see there are a lot of vehicles continuously running on the road. The proportion of Traffic Police and Vehicle is 100:1. In this condition it is really almost impossible for a traffic police to penalize and make a surveillance of all the vehicles. With a view to solve the problem more reliably and flexibly we are introducing Traffic Operation and Surveillance System (TOSS) to improve the system. Moreover, its simplicity and attractive user interface will make sure to provide most accurate results and operations in a less time-consuming way.
